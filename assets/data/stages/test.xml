	<!-- oh yeah those exist
	where the first one go
	you saw the video?
	the wha
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6iQrh2TK98
	well that explains a bit
	whats weird is that i typically think of the number *twenty* seven
    guess my favortie number
	37
	-23.47
	interesting
	oops
	you will be surprised how it looks after me wizard and yosh used it lol, 268kb
	
	also i love how most of nthis files size comes from the convo
	37 is a wacky number so im using that for testing
 // maybe box? so its colors
 wrong format lol (im on stepmania xml) 
 also just realized i cant scale boxes, you can, just not <solid> 
 we may need a different func for boxes/solids. 
 storedScale should still work
 and when we save we just have to save either width and scale.x, or calculate the width from the scale
 i think we can do sprite.frameWidth * sprite.scale.x when saving boxes luckfully
 oh yeah -->

 <!-- <box == makeGraphic -->
 <!-- <solid == makeSolid -->
